            non-volatile memory technology. The STM8 allows fast and safe development through enhanced<br/>
            stack pointer operations, advanced addressing modes and new instructions.<br>
            <b>The STM8 platform supports four product series:</b><br/>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">- STM8S, mainstream MCUs</p>
